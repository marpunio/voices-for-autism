Voices for Autism is a 3-tier web application built entirely on AWS using a microservices architecture. This program aims to help autistic students enrolled in Bro's United. Voices for Autism is an application that was built on the foundation of the Bro’s United Mentorship program. Bro’s United mentorship program is an eight week big-brother little-brother mentorship program where college-aged students are paired up with 1 to 2 little brothers on the autism spectrum in an effort to develop their social skills by exposing them to students in higher education in a safe and fun environment. Voices for Autism helps the lives of autistic children by helping them with their cognitive and social skills that will help them transition to adulthood.
